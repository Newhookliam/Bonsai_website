    <p>Due to covid and the ever growing bonsai community i have decided to build my own website and show you a few either for sale or within my bonsai collection.</p>

    <p>During the Pandemic, it has been rough on a lot of people and being able to focus our minds elsewhere has been handy to say the least. through my website if you have any questions or you have any feedback on the way this is presented or displayed please let me know.</p>
